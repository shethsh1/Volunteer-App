Deployed website: https://protected-everglades-78341.herokuapp.com/

The purpose of our project is to provide a service for people affected by COVID-19 or other viruses
needing quarantine. Our main target population are vulnerable people. Our application serves as a
platform for those in social isolation to be able to ask for help with essentials such as groceries, food and
medical supplies. The way our platform works is by having two separate parties, volunteers and
consumers. Volunteers are able to sign up with our service with a sole reason to help people in need.
People in need will also be able to sign up and make posts about help that they need with details about
location, time and the kind of help required. This relates to the themes of public health and community
response because it’s preventing disease to those that are possibly in self-quarantine and can’t leave
their homes by giving a free service for other volunteers to assist them. 

**TA note: Everything from the proposal was finished except two very minor details that I don't know if it's even worth mentioning, but we chose to not include the name of the app in the top left and profile pages don't have an edit biography. The biography kinda looked cluttered and unneeded, and we never decided on a name for this app so thats why that was excluded**
